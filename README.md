# krill-swimming-params

This is the final saved parameterised model for individual swimming parameters of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Data that this model is based off was collected over 2 seasons at Palmer Station as part of the NSF funded grants 1840927 (Marc Weissburg - GATech) & 1840949 (David Fields - Bigelow Labs). Data analysis and statistics on the kinematics of krill swimming behaviour was performed by Nicole Hellessey with assistance from Nicholas Record.

The full list of swimming parameters and their associated models is given below.
